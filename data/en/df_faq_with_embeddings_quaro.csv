"What is an emergency use authorization and how is it being used to respond to COVID-19?
","In certain types of emergencies, the FDA can issue an emergency use authorization, or EUA, to provide more timely access to critical medical products (including medicines and tests) that may help during the emergency when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternative options.

The EUA process is different than FDA approval, clearance, or licensing because the EUA standard may permit authorization based on significantly less data than would be required for approval, clearance, or licensing by the FDA. This enables the FDA to authorize the emergency use of medical products that meet the criteria within weeks rather than months to years. 

EUAs are in effect until the emergency declaration ends but can be revised or revoked as we evaluate the needs during the emergency and new data on the product’s safety and effectiveness, or as products meet the criteria to become approved, cleared, or licensed by the FDA.

"How can I prevent COVID-19?
","The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus. The CDC recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases. They include: 

Wash your hands often with plain soap and water. The CDC recommends washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol. Learn more about safely using hand sanitizer.
Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face covering or non-surgical mask when around others. Find more information about how to select, wear, and clean your mask.
Get the COVID-19 vaccine when it is offered to you. Once you are fully vaccinated, you may be able to start doing some things that you had stopped doing because of the pandemic.

"Should I wear a face covering or mask when I go out in public?
","The CDC recommends wearing masks in public when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Effective February 2, 2021, masks are required on planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation traveling into, within, or out of the United States and in U.S. transportation hubs such as airports and stations. Read more about the CDC’s Mask Requirement.

The FDA has authorized the emergency use of face masks, including cloth face coverings, that meet certain criteria for use as source control by the general public and health care personnel in accordance with CDC recommendations during the COVID-19 public health emergency. The FDA also regulates other medical devices, including personal protective equipment (PPE) such as surgical masks and N95 respirators.

"What treatments are available for COVID-19?
","On October 22, 2020, the FDA approved the antiviral drug Veklury (remdesivir) for use in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg) for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Veklury should only be administered in a hospital or in a healthcare setting capable of providing acute care comparable to inpatient hospital care.  

This approval does not include the entire population that had been authorized to use Veklury under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) originally issued on May 1, 2020. In order to ensure continued access to the pediatric population previously covered under the EUA, the FDA revised the EUA for Veklury to permit the drug’s use by licensed healthcare providers for the treatment of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in hospitalized pediatric patients 3.5 kg to less than 40 kg or hospitalized pediatric patients less than 12 years of age weighing at least 3.5 kg. For additional information on the authorized use of Veklury under the EUA, refer to the Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers.

Clinical trials assessing the safety and efficacy of Veklury (remdesivir) in this pediatric patient population are ongoing. 

The National Institutes of Health provides more information about treatment options.

People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home.

"Can I prevent or treat COVID-19 by using disinfectant sprays, wipes, or liquids on my skin? Can I inject, inhale, or ingest (swallow) disinfectants to prevent or treat COVID-19?
","No. Disinfectants should not be used on human or animal skin. Disinfectants may cause serious skin and eye irritation. 

Disinfectants are dangerous for people to inject, inhale, or ingest. If you breathe, inject, or swallow disinfectants you may be seriously hurt or die. If someone near you swallows, injects, or breathes a disinfectant, call poison control or a medical professional immediately.

"Does spraying people with disinfectant lower the spread of COVID-19?
","Currently there are no data showing that spraying people with aerosolized disinfectants, or having people walk through tunnels or rooms where disinfectant is in the air, can treat, prevent, or lower the spread of COVID-19.

Surface disinfectants should not be used on people or animals. Disinfectant products, such as sprays, mists, wipes, or liquids are only to be used on hard, non-porous surfaces (materials that do not absorb liquids easily) such as floors and countertops, or on soft surfaces such as mattresses, sofas, and beds. CDC provides information regarding disinfectant practices for surfaces in the Reopening Guidance for Cleaning and Disinfecting Public Spaces, Workplaces, Businesses, Schools, and Homes. 

Human antiseptic drugs, such as hand sanitizers, are intended for use on human skin, but are not intended for aerosolization (to be sprayed in the air in very small droplets).  Due to serious safety concerns, including the risk of inhalational toxicity and flammability, the FDA’s temporary policies for alcohol-based hand sanitizers during the COVID-19 public health emergency specifically do not apply to aerosol sprays.  In addition, hand sanitizers are intended for use on the hands, and should never be used over larger body surfaces, swallowed, or inhaled.

"Is hand sanitizer effective against COVID-19?
","The best way to prevent the spread of infections and decrease the risk of getting sick is by washing your hands with plain soap and water, advises the CDC. Washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is essential, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing, or blowing one’s nose. If soap and water are not available, CDC recommends consumers use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

"Why has the FDA placed alcohol-based hand sanitizers from Mexico on import alert?
","During the coronavirus pandemic, the FDA has seen a sharp increase in hand sanitizer products from Mexico that were labeled to contain ethanol (also called ethyl alcohol) but, among other concerns, tested positive for methanol contamination. Methanol (or wood alcohol) can be toxic when absorbed through the skin and life-threatening when ingested. Methanol is not an acceptable ingredient in hand sanitizer.

Recently, the FDA placed all alcohol-based hand sanitizers from Mexico on a country-wide import alert to help prevent entry into the U.S. of potentially dangerous products until we can review the product’s safety. An import alert informs field staff the FDA has sufficient evidence to detain products (at the border/import site) that appear to violate laws and regulations without physical examination. FDA analyses of alcohol-based hand sanitizers from Mexico found that 84 percent of the samples we analyzed from April through December 2020 were not in compliance with FDA regulations.

Import alerts:

Help prevent potentially violative products from being distributed in the United States;
Help free-up agency resources to examine other shipments;
Provide uniform information to FDA field offices across the country;

"Where can I buy hand sanitizer? Can I make my own hand sanitizer?
","Many retail stores and pharmacies sell hand sanitizers. However, we understand that many stores may not have hand sanitizers available to buy. To help increase the availability of hand sanitizers, the FDA has issued guidance for the temporary preparation of alcohol-based hand sanitizers by some companies and pharmacies during the COVID-19 public health emergency. 

The FDA does not recommend that consumers make their own hand sanitizer. If made incorrectly, hand sanitizer can be ineffective, and there have been reports of skin burns from homemade hand sanitizer. The agency lacks verifiable information on the methods being used to prepare hand sanitizer at home and whether they are safe for use on human skin.

"What is the risk of using a hand sanitizer that contains methanol (wood alcohol) or 1-propanol?
","Methanol exposure can result in nausea, vomiting, headache, blurred vision, permanent blindness, seizures, coma, permanent damage to the nervous system or death. Although people using these products on their hands are at risk for methanol poisoning, young children who accidentally swallow these products and adolescents and adults who drink these products as an alcohol (ethanol) substitute are most at risk.

Swallowing or drinking a hand sanitizer with 1-propanol can result in decreased breathing and heart rate, among other serious symptoms, and can lead to death.

"Am I at risk for serious complications from COVID-19 if I smoke cigarettes?
","Yes. Data shows that when compared to never smokers, cigarette smoking increases the risk of more severe illness from COVID-19, which could result in hospitalization, the need for intensive care, or even death. Smoking cigarettes can cause inflammation and cell damage throughout the body, and can weaken your immune system, making it less able to fight off disease.

There’s never been a better time to quit smoking. If you need resources to help you quit smoking, the FDA’s Every Try Counts campaign has supportive tips and tools to help you get closer to quitting for good.

"What is the FDA’s role in approving vaccines and what is being done to produce a COVID-19 vaccine?
","The FDA regulates vaccines. Vaccines undergo a rigorous review of laboratory, clinical and manufacturing data to ensure the safety, effectiveness, and quality of these products. Vaccines approved for marketing may also be required to undergo additional studies to further evaluate the vaccine and often to address specific questions about the vaccine's safety, effectiveness, or possible side effects.

On August 23, 2021, the FDA approved the first COVID-19 vaccine, known as the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, now known as Comirnaty (koe-mir’-na-tee), for the prevention of the disease in individuals 16 years of age and older. The vaccine also continues to be available under emergency use authorization (EUA), including for people 12 through 15 years of age and for the administration of a third dose in certain immunocompromised individuals. More information on the approval can be found here.

On December 11, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. On December 18, 2020, the FDA issued an EUA for the use of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. And on February 27, 2021 the FDA issued an EUA for the use of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. The issuance of an EUA is different than an FDA approval (licensure) of a vaccine.

In determining whether to issue an EUA for a product, the FDA evaluates the available evidence and assesses any known or potential risks and any known or potential benefits. And if the benefit-risk assessment is favorable, the product is made available during the public health emergency. Once a manufacturer submits an EUA request for a COVID-19 vaccine, the FDA then evaluates the request and determines whether the relevant statutory criteria are met, taking into account the totality of the scientific evidence about the vaccine that is available to the agency.

In addition to supporting product development for high priority COVID-19 vaccines, the FDA continues to expedite clinical trials for additional vaccine candidates, providing timely advice to and interactions with vaccine developers.

"Is an approval (or biologics license approval) different from an emergency use authorization? Does it change the availability of COVID-19 vaccines?
","Emergency use authorizations (EUAs) can be used by the FDA during public health emergencies to provide access to medical products that may be effective in preventing or treating a disease. In determining whether to issue an EUA for a product, after the FDA receives an application, it evaluates the data submitted, conducts its own analyses and assesses any known or potential risks and any known or potential benefits. For COVID-19 vaccines that received emergency use authorization from the FDA, the agency evaluated data submitted by the manufacturers about the COVID-19 vaccine’s safety and effectiveness, and conducted its own analyses, before reaching each decision and found it to be clear and compelling to support its use for the prevention of COVID-19. Emergency use authorization is a tool that the FDA can use in a declared public health emergency, like the pandemic that we are in now, in order to more rapidly make potentially life-saving products available under very specific conditions.

An FDA-approved vaccine has undergone the agency’s standard process for reviewing medical products, including vaccines, drugs and medical devices. The FDA’s review process for a vaccine relies upon the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) by the manufacturer. A BLA is a comprehensive submission that is submitted to the agency and must meet very specific requirements. For the COVID-19 vaccines, a BLA builds on the data and information that supported the EUA, such as preclinical and clinical data and information, as well as details of the manufacturing process and inspections at the sites at which the vaccine is made. The FDA’s review of a BLA is among the most comprehensive in the world. We conduct our own analyses of the information in the BLA to make sure the vaccines are safe and effective and meet our standards for approval. The FDA also inspects the facilities that are involved in the manufacturing of the product.

"How long does it take to approve COVID-19 vaccines?
","On August 23, 2021, the FDA approved the first COVID-19 vaccine, known as the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, now known as Comirnaty (koe-mir’-na-tee), for the prevention of the disease in individuals 16 years of age and older. The vaccine also continues to be available under emergency use authorization (EUA), including for people 12 through 15 years of age and for the administration of a third dose in certain immunocompromised individuals. More information on the approval can be found here.

Each review of a COVID-19 vaccine for approval is unique and the amount of time it takes may be different. Having safe and effective approved COVID-19 vaccines is a top priority for the FDA. The process involves incredible expertise and attention to detail, which is critical to ensuring that the FDA’s rigorous standards are met.

Our team is reviewing tremendous amounts of data. Vaccine applications have the equivalent of hundreds of thousands of pages of data and other information – more than what is submitted as part of an EUA. When a BLA comes in, we have to make sure there is accurate safety and effectiveness information and manufacturing data. We also conduct inspections and develop testing protocols to make sure that every lot of vaccine that is released meets rigorous quality standards.

We fully support the quality and rigor of our review process. We conduct our own analyses of the information in the BLA to make sure the vaccines are safe and effective and meet our standards for approval. We must be able to stand behind our decision once we approve these vaccines, so we and the public can feel confident that the vaccines they receive are safe and effective.

"Should I get a booster shot or an additional shot of a COVID-19 vaccine?

"How important is it to make sure approved vaccines are available versus other public health measures? Do you have the resources to do this quickly?
","Evaluating the data with the goal of approving safe and effective vaccines is a top priority for the FDA. We are aligning resources to not only prioritize COVID-19 vaccines, but also support our broad public health mission. We recognize the pressing need and public health imperative of approving vaccines and are expediently conducting a high-quality review. We are using “sprint teams,” which include staff members from across all the offices in the FDA, to help support the experts in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research in doing their vaccine work, including review of applications submitted for approval.

We recognize that an approved vaccine may encourage more people to get the vaccine. We firmly believe that everyone should get their COVID-19 vaccine now. For those who have waited until there is more information available on the safety and effectiveness of a vaccine, the FDA has been carefully monitoring the safety and effectiveness of all COVID-19 vaccines that the agency has authorized under EUA and the data strongly support the use of the vaccines. We also realize that for some, FDA approval of a COVID-19 vaccine may bring additional confidence and encourage them to get the vaccine. We are committed to prioritizing our review, but we are also committed to following our rigorous processes.

We have also received many questions from employers, educational institutions, and state and local governments about the status of vaccine approvals.

"How does FDA ensure the quality of COVID-19 vaccines and other medical products authorized for emergency use in the United States?
","The FDA takes its responsibility for helping to ensure the quality of manufacturing of vaccines and other medical products for use during this pandemic very seriously. The agency is using a variety of inspectional tools to help ensure that products being produced in different facilities meet the high-quality standards that Americans have come to expect. It is important to note that even when companies use contract manufacturing organizations, it is ultimately the responsibility of the company that holds the emergency use authorization to ensure that the quality standards of the FDA are met. No product can be distributed by manufacturers until the FDA authorizes its distribution from the facility that is manufacturing it.

"How do I report COVID-19 vaccine side effects?
","If you experience a severe allergic reaction or any life-threatening symptoms such as trouble breathing, call 911, or go to the nearest hospital. 

Call the vaccination provider or your health care provider if you have any side effects that bother you or do not go away. Report vaccine side effects to FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The VAERS toll-free number is 1-800-822-7967 or report online to https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html. Please include the name of the vaccine in the first line of box #18 of the report form. 

You may also be given an option to enroll in v-safe. V-safe is a new voluntary smartphone-based tool that uses text messaging and web surveys to check in with people who have been vaccinated to identify potential side effects after COVID-19 vaccination. V-safe asks questions that help CDC monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines.

"Can the FDA help me get a COVID-19 vaccine?
","No. The FDA’s authority includes authorizing or approving COVID-19 vaccines for use in the United States, but the FDA is not responsible for vaccine distribution. Go to the CDC website to find your state and local health departments who are responsible for COVID-19 vaccine distribution. All questions and concerns should be sent to your state government or local health department. The U.S. government’s goal is to have enough COVID-19 vaccine doses for all people in the United States who choose to be vaccinated.

If you are contacted directly by someone who says they are from the FDA about a COVID-19 vaccine appointment, it is a scam.

"What steps are being taken to protect the U.S. blood supply from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19?
","
A: Blood donors must be healthy and feel well on the day of donation. Routine blood donor screening measures that are already in place should prevent individuals with respiratory infections from donating blood. For example, blood donors must be in good health and have a normal temperature on the day of donation.

Donors are instructed to contact the donor center if they become ill after donation, so that their blood or plasma will not be used. Even when a donor develops COVID-19 after donation, however, there have been no cases of COVID-19 linked to donor blood or products made from blood.   

The FDA has provided additional information to blood establishments on its website.

"Why aren’t blood centers testing donors for SARS-CoV-2?
","
A: At this time, the FDA does not recommend using laboratory tests to screen blood. Someone who has symptoms of COVID-19, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath, is not healthy enough to donate blood.

"What is convalescent plasma and why is it being investigated to treat COVID-19?
","Convalescent refers to anyone recovering from a disease. Plasma is the yellow, liquid part of blood that contains antibodies. Antibodies are proteins made by the body in response to infections.  Convalescent plasma from patients who have already recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may contain antibodies against COVID-19. The FDA has issued an emergency use authorization for the use of convalescent plasma in hospitalized patients. It is being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.

"I recently recovered from COVID-19, can I donate convalescent plasma?
","
A: COVID-19 convalescent plasma must only be collected from recovered individuals if they are eligible to donate blood. Individuals must have had a prior diagnosis of COVID-19 documented by a laboratory test and meet other laboratory criteria.

"What does it mean to be an FDA-approved drug?

"What is the FDA’s role in regulating potential treatments during a public health emergency?
","The FDA carries out many activities to protect and promote public health during a public health emergency, including helping to accelerate the development and availability of potential treatments, protecting the security of drug supply chains, providing guidance to food and medical device manufacturers, advising developers on clinical trial issues, and keeping the public informed with authoritative health information.

"Are there any FDA-approved drugs (medicines) for COVID-19?
","Yes, the FDA has approved Veklury (remdesivir) for certain COVID-19 patients. Read more about the approval here.

Additionally, during public health emergencies, the FDA may in certain circumstances authorize use of unapproved drugs or unapproved uses of approved drugs for life-threatening conditions when there are no adequate, approved, and available options and other conditions are met. This is called an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).

Researchers are studying new drugs, and medicines that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA created the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program (CTAP) to use every available method to move new treatments to patients. Additionally, the FDA is working with the National Institutes of Health, drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partnersExternal Link Disclaimer to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. FDA’s Sentinel SystemExternal Link Disclaimer is being used to monitor the use of drugs, describe the course of illness among hospitalized patients, and evaluate the treatment impact of therapies actively being used under real-world conditions.

For information about clinical trials for COVID-19 treatments visit clinicaltrials.gov and the COVID-19 Prevention NetworkExternal Link Disclaimer.

"What is a monoclonal antibody?
","Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-produced molecules that act as substitute antibodies that can restore, enhance or mimic the immune system's attack on cells. Monoclonal antibodies for COVID-19 may block the virus that causes COVID-19 from attaching to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce and cause harm.

"Is REGEN-COV, the monoclonal antibodies casirivimab and imdevimab administered together, FDA-approved to treat COVID-19?
","No. REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) are not FDA-approved to treat any diseases or conditions, including COVID-19. However, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for REGEN-COV for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age or older weighing at least 40 kilograms) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19. This includes those who are 65 years of age or older or who have certain chronic medical conditions.

REGEN-COV is also authorized for emergency use to prevent COVID-19 after exposure in adults and pediatric individuals (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death.

"Is the monoclonal antibody Actemra (tocilizumab) approved for the treatment of COVID-19?
","No. Actemra (tocilizumab) is not approved as a treatment for COVID-19. However, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for use of Actemra by healthcare providers for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults and pediatric patients (2 years of age and older) who are receiving systemic corticosteroids and require supplemental oxygen, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

Actemra is a monoclonal antibody that reduces inflammation by blocking the interleukin-6 receptor.

"Are chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19?
","No. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate and some versions of chloroquine phosphate are FDA-approved to treat malaria. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is also FDA-approved to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.

On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate to treat adults and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19 for whom a clinical trial was not available or participation was not feasible. Based on FDA’s continued review of the scientific evidence available, the criteria for an EUA for chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate as outlined in Section 564(c)(2) of the FD&C Act are no longer met.

"Should I take chloroquine phosphate used to treat disease in aquarium fish to prevent or treat COVID-19?
","No. Products marketed for veterinary use, “for research only,” or otherwise not for human consumption have not been evaluated for safety or effectiveness and should never be used by humans. The FDA is aware that chloroquine phosphate is marketed to treat disease in aquarium fish, but these products have not been evaluated by the FDA to determine if they are safe, effective, properly manufactured, and adequately labeled. The agency continues to work with online marketplaces to remove these items, and many have been removed based on these efforts.

"Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19?
","No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses; they only work on bacterial infections. Antibiotics do not prevent or treat COVID-19, because COVID-19 is caused by a virus, not bacteria. Some patients with COVID-19 may also develop a bacterial infection, such as pneumonia. In that case, a health care professional may treat the bacterial infection with an antibiotic.

"Should I take ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19?
","No. While there are approved uses for ivermectin in people and animals, it is not approved for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. You should not take any medicine to treat or prevent COVID-19 unless it has been prescribed to you by your health care provider and acquired from a legitimate source. 

A recently released research articleExternal Link Disclaimer described the effect of ivermectin on SARS-CoV-2 in a laboratory setting.

"What is the FDA doing to protect people from products making fraudulent COVID-19 claims?
","We have established a cross-agency team dedicated to closely monitoring for fraudulent COVID-19 products. In response to internet scammers, the FDA has taken – and continues to take – actions to stop those selling unapproved products that fraudulently claim to prevent, treat, diagnose or cure COVID-19. The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issue warning letters to companies and individuals that are unlawfully selling unapproved products with fraudulent COVID-19 claims. The FDA also has taken enforcement action against certain sellers that continued to illegally market products for prevention or treatment of COVID-19. 

Additionally, the FDA also has reached out to major retailers to ask for their help in monitoring online marketplaces for fraudulent COVID-19 products.

"Will there be drug shortages due to COVID-19?
","The FDA has been closely monitoring the supply chain with the expectation that the COVID-19 outbreak would likely impact the medical product supply chain, including potential disruptions to supply or shortages of critical medical products in the U.S. 

We have been reaching out to manufacturers as part of our approach to identifying potential disruptions or shortages. We will use all available tools to react swiftly and mitigate the impact to U.S. patients and health care professionals when a potential disruption or shortage is identified.

"Is there a test for COVID-19?
","Yes, the FDA has issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for different types of COVID-19 tests. Some tests are used to diagnose the virus that causes COVID-19 infection whereas other tests are used to detect a recent or prior COVID-19 infection. There are 2 different types of COVID-19 diagnostic tests -- molecular tests and antigen tests. Molecular tests detect the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. Antigen tests detect specific proteins made by the virus. Tests that detect recent or prior COVID-19 infection are called antibody or serology tests. The EUAs allow the emergency use of tests during the COVID-19 emergency when the FDA determines certain criteria are met.

"How are people tested for COVID-19?
","Most tests to diagnose COVID-19 require a swab of your nose, or the part of the throat behind the nose, by a health care provider. Some tests use saliva (spit) or other types of samples. For most FDA-authorized tests, the swab or sample must be sent to a lab for analysis. Some tests allow the patient to collect the sample at home and then send it to a lab for analysis. Some tests can be analyzed at the point-of-care, such as in a doctor’s office or health clinic. The FDA has also authorized some at-home tests that allow a person to collect their sample and run the test completely at home without sending anything to a lab.

"Are there any at-home tests for COVID-19?

"What is the difference between the types of tests available for SARS-CoV-2?
","There are two different types of tests – diagnostic tests and antibody tests.

A diagnostic test can show if you have an active coronavirus infection and should take steps to quarantine or isolate yourself from others. Currently there are two types of diagnostic tests – molecular (RT-PCR) tests that detect the virus’s genetic material, and antigen tests that detect specific proteins on the surface of the virus. Samples are typically collected with a nasal or throat swab, or saliva collected by spitting into a tube.
An antibody test looks for antibodies that are made by the immune system in response to a threat, such as a specific virus. Antibodies can help fight infections. Antibodies can take several days or weeks to develop after you have an infection and may stay in your blood for several weeks after recovery. Because of this, antibody tests should not be used to diagnose an active coronavirus infection. At this time, researchers do not know if the presence of antibodies means that you are immune to the coronavirus in the future. While there is a lot of uncertainty with this new virus, it is also possible that, over time, broad use of antibody tests and clinical follow-up will provide the medical community with more information on whether or not, and how long, a person who has recovered from the virus is at lower risk of infection if they are exposed to the virus again.

"Should I purchase personal protective equipment such as facemasks or N95 respirators for me and my family?
","No. Surgical masks and N95s need to be reserved for use by health care workers, first responders, and other frontline workers whose jobs put them at much greater risk of acquiring COVID-19. The cloth face coverings recommended by CDC are not surgical masks or N95 respirators.

"Is there a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and N95 respirators or of ventilators?
","The FDA has been working closely with PPE and ventilator manufacturers to understand their supply capabilities during this pandemic. The agency is also aware of challenges throughout the supply chain that are presently impacting the availability of PPE products and is taking steps to mitigate shortages that health care facilities are already experiencing. 

The FDA issued new guidance to give ventilator manufacturers and non-medical device manufacturers more flexibility to start making new ventilators and parts. We adjusted our screening of PPE  and medical devices at U.S. ports of entry to expedite imports of legitimate products into the U.S. With CDC we took action to make more respirators, including certain N95s, available to health care personnel for use in health care settings.

"Can 3D printing be used to make PPE?
","Personal protective equipment (PPE) includes protective clothing, gowns, gloves, face shields, goggles, face masks, and respirators or other equipment designed to protect the wearer from injury or the spread of infection or illness. While it is possible to use 3D printing to make certain PPE, there are technical challenges. 3D-printed PPE may provide a physical barrier, but 3D-printed PPE are unlikely to provide the same fluid barrier and air filtration protection as FDA-cleared surgical masks and N95 respirators. The CDC has recommendations for how to optimize the supply of face masks. Find more information about 3D printing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Will there be food shortages?
","In some cases the inventory of certain foods at your grocery store might be temporarily low before stores can restock. Food production and manufacturing generally are widely dispersed throughout the U.S., however; there is a significant shift in where consumers are buying food during the pandemic. While food use in large-scale establishments, such as hotels, restaurants, sports arenas/stadiums and universities suddenly declined, the demand for food at grocery stores increased.  

The FDA has issued temporary guidance to provide flexibility in packaging and labeling requirements to support food supply chains and get foods to the consumer retail marketplace. The FDA is closely monitoring the food supply chain for any shortages in collaboration with industry and our federal and state partners.

"Why is the FDA providing flexibility to food manufacturers, under limited circumstances during the COVID-19 public health emergency, to make minor changes in ingredients without reflecting those changes on the package label?
","Due to limited shortages of specific ingredients and foods, or unexpected supply chain disruptions in some industries, food manufacturers may need to make small changes to some ingredients during the COVID-19 public health emergency. Manufacturers may not be able to relabel their products to reflect these minor changes on the food label without slowing down the processing or distribution of the food.

To avoid slowing down food processing or distribution during the coronavirus pandemic, the FDA issued a guidance titled ""Temporary Policy Regarding Certain Food Labeling Requirements During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency: Minor Formulation Changes and Vending Machines.""  The temporary policy provides food manufacturers with flexibility to make minor formulation changes in certain, limited circumstances without making conforming label changes on packages as long as any substitutions or omissions of ingredients do not pose a health or safety issue (such as allergens), and do not cause significant changes in the finished product.

"What do I need to know about the temporary policy for food labeling of minor ingredient changes during the COVID-19 public health emergency if I have food allergies?
","lthough the temporary policy allows some flexibility, the eight major food allergens under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA) of 2004 cannot be substituted for labeled ingredients by manufacturers without a corresponding label change. While the temporary policy does not list all ingredients known to cause sensitivities in some people, manufacturers should avoid substituting ingredients with major food allergens or with ingredients recognized as priority allergens (such as sesame, celery, lupin, buckwheat, molluscan shellfish, and mustard) in other parts of the world without a label change. These flexibilities are intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency in the United States. However, when this public health emergency is over, extensions may be needed if the food and agriculture sectors need additional time to bring supply chains back into regular order.

"Can I get the coronavirus from food, food packaging, or food containers and preparation area?
","Currently there is no evidence of food, food containers, or food packaging being associated with transmission of COVID-19.  Like other viruses, it is possible that the virus that causes COVID-19 can survive on surfaces or objects. 

If you are concerned about contamination of food or food packaging, wash your hands after handling food packaging, after removing food from the packaging, before you prepare food for eating and before you eat. Consumers can follow CDC guidelines on frequent hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; and frequently clean and disinfect surfaces.

"Is the U.S. food supply safe?
","Currently there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with transmission of COVID-19.   

Unlike foodborne gastrointestinal (GI) viruses like norovirus and hepatitis A that often make people ill through contaminated food, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is a virus that causes respiratory illness and not gastrointestinal illness, and foodborne exposure to this virus is not known to be a route of transmission.

It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

"Can I get COVID-19 from a food worker handling my food?
","Currently, there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with transmission of COVID-19. However, the virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person in some communities in the U.S. The CDC recommends that if you are sick, stay home until you are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others. 

Anyone handling, preparing and serving food should always follow safe food handling procedures, such as washing hands and surfaces often.

"Should food workers who are ill stay home?
","CDC recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home and not come to work until they are free of fever (100.4° F [37.8° C] or greater using an oral thermometer), signs of a fever, and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medicines (e.g. cough suppressants). Employees should notify their supervisor and stay home if they are sick.

"Should food facilities (grocery stores, manufacturing facilities, restaurants, etc.) perform any special cleaning or sanitation procedures for COVID-19?
","CDC recommends routine cleaning of all frequently touched surfaces in the workplace, such as workstations, countertops, and doorknobs. Use the cleaning agents that are usually used in these areas and follow the directions on the label. CDC does not recommend any additional disinfection beyond routine cleaning at this time.

Restaurants and retail food establishments are regulated at the state and local level. State, local, and tribal regulators use the Food Code published by the FDA to develop or update their own food safety rules. Generally, FDA-regulated food manufacturers are required to maintain clean facilities, including, as appropriate, clean and sanitized food contact surfaces, and to have food safety plans in place.

"What is the FDA doing to respond to foodborne illnesses during the COVID-19 pandemic?
","The virus that causes COVID-19 is a virus that causes respiratory illness. Viruses like norovirus and hepatitis A that can make people sick through contaminated food usually cause gastrointestinal or stomach illness. Currently there is no evidence of food, food containers, or food packaging being associated with transmission of COVID-19.  

The CDC, FDA, and USDA continue to work with state and local partners to investigate foodborne illness and outbreaks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The FDA’s Coordinated Outbreak Response and Evaluation (CORE) Network manages outbreak response, as well as surveillance and post-response activities related to incidents involving multiple illnesses linked to FDA-regulated human food products. During this coronavirus outbreak, CORE’s full-time staff will continue to operate to prepare for, coordinate and carry out response activities to incidents of foodborne illnesses.

"Can my pet get COVID-19 from me or other people?
","The virus that causes COVID-19 can spread from people to animals including pets in some situations, mostly during close contact. If a person inside the household becomes sick, isolate that person from everyone else, including pets and other animals.

We know that most pets that get infected do so after close contact with their owner or other household member with COVID-19. Consult CDC’s website for the latest recommendations about how to protect pets from the virus.

If you are sick with COVID-19 (either suspected or confirmed by a test), you should avoid contact with your pets and other animals, just like you would with people.

When possible, have another member of your household care for your pets while you are sick.
Avoid contact with your pet including petting snuggling, being kissed or licked, sharing food, and sleeping in the same bed.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you have COVID-19, wear a mask and wash your hands before and after you interact with them.

"What should I do if I think my pet has the virus that causes COVID-19?
","Pets infected with this virus may or may not get ill. Of the pets that have gotten sick, most only had mild illness and fully recovered. Serious illness in pets appears to be extremely rare.

Pets that do have symptoms usually have mild illness that can be taken care of at home. If you think your pet is sick with the virus or if you have concerns about your pet’s health, talk to your veterinarian. Most pets that have gotten sick from the virus that causes COVID-19 were infected after close contact with a person with COVID-19.

If your pet is sick and you think it might be from the virus that causes COVID-19, talk to your veterinarian.

If you are sick with COVID-19 and your pet becomes sick, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself. Call your veterinarian and let them know you have been sick with COVID-19. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet’s treatment and care.

"Is there a test for COVID-19 in pets? If so, has it been approved by the FDA?
","Certain veterinary diagnostic laboratories have developed diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, for use in pets if needed. 

Diagnostic tests for animals are regulated differently than those for humans. The FDA does not require approval or clearance of a 510(k), PMA, or any other pre-market submission for devices, including diagnostic tests, intended for animal use. The FDA does, however, have post-market regulatory oversight over devices intended for animal use and can take appropriate regulatory action if an animal device is misbranded or adulterated.

Certain private, state, and university veterinary diagnostic laboratories have developed diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, for use in dogs and cats. The FDA is also aware of at least two veterinary tests for COVID-19 in pets developed by commercial laboratories initially for internal surveillance, but the agency has not evaluated the validity of these tests. The tests are not currently available for routine testing. The decision to test pets should be made collaboratively between local, state, or federal public and animal health officials.

"Should I get my pet tested for COVID-19?
","Routine testing of pets for COVID-19 is not recommended at this time. There is currently no evidence that animals are a source of COVID-19 infection in the United States. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of pets spreading the virus is considered to be low. If your pet is sick, consult your veterinarian. 

Animal testing is reserved for situations when the results may affect the treatment or management of people and animals. If your veterinarian thinks your pet is a candidate for testing, they will consult the state veterinarian and public health officials. Do not contact your state veterinarians directly: they do not have the client/patient-veterinarian relationship that would allow them to fully understand the situation and they are also actively involved in other animal disease-related emergencies as well as response to COVID-19.

"What animal species can get COVID-19?
","We currently don’t fully understand how COVID-19 affects different animal species.

We are aware of a small number of pets, including dogs, cats and a ferret reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 after close contact with people with COVID-19. Infected pets might get sick or they might not have any symptoms. Of the pets that have gotten sick, most only had mild illness and fully recovered.

Several animals in zoos and sanctuaries have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, including big cats in captivity (lions, tigers, pumas, cougars, snow leopards),and gorillas  after showing signs of respiratory illness. It is suspected these animals became sick after being exposed to zoo employees with COVID-19. In many situations, this happened despite the staff wearing personal protective equipment and following COVID-19 precautions.

The virus that causes COVID-19 has been reported in minks on farms in multiple countries, including the United States. Once the virus is introduced on a farm, spread can occur between mink as well as from mink to other animals on the farm (dogs, cats). Because some workers on these farms had COVID-19, it is likely that infected farm workers were the initial source of mink infections.

Recent experimental research shows that many mammals, including ferrets, cats, dogs, fruit bats, bank voles, mink, pigs, rabbits, racoon dogs, tree shrews, white-tailed deer and golden Syrian hamsters can be infected with the virus. Cats, ferrets, fruit bats, hamsters, raccoon dogs and white-tailed deer  can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings. Chickens and ducks do not seem to become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies. These findings were based upon a small number of animals and do not indicate whether animals can spread infection to people. Data from one study suggest that dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets. There is some evidence to suggest that laboratory mice, which could not be infected with original strains of SARS-CoV-2, can be infected with new virus variants. 

For any animal that tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 at a private or state laboratory, USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories performs additional testing to confirm the infection and posts the results on this page: Cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Animals in the United States.

"Can pets carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin or fur?
","lthough we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.

However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them and especially after cleaning up their waste.

Do not wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or other products, such as hand sanitizer, counter-cleaning wipes, or other industrial or surface cleaners. If you have questions about appropriate products for bathing or cleaning your pet, talk to your veterinarian. If your pet gets hand sanitizer on their skin or fur, rinse or wipe down your pet with water immediately.

"Are there any approved products that can prevent or treat COVID-19 in animals?
","No. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act, “articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals” are drugs. The FDA has not approved any drugs for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of COVID-19 in animals. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) regulates veterinary biologics, including vaccines, diagnostic kits, and other products of biological origin.

"My pet has health problems and goes to the vet regularly for treatment. Should I be doing anything different to manage their health during the COVID-19 outbreak?
","While you should not avoid necessary visits to your veterinarian due to the COVID-19 outbreak, you should exercise reasonable caution just like you would if you were going to any other public place. If you are concerned about your own health or that of your pet when going to the veterinarian, contact their office in advance to discuss any recommended precautions.
